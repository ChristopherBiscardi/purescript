# Purescript

PureScript is a small strongly typed programming language that
compiles to JavaScript.

# Language

## DSLs

PureScriptâ€™s expressive type system and lightweight syntax make it
simple to define [domain-specific languages][dsl], which can be used to solve
problems like templating the DOM. Bindings also exist for libraries
such as React and Angular.js.

```purescript
import Data.DOM.Free

doc :: Element
doc = div [ _class := "image" ] $ do
  elem $ img [ src := "logo.jpg"
             , width  := 100
             , height := 200
             ]
  text "Functional programming for the web!"
```

## Generative Testing

PureScript provides a form of ad-hoc polymorphism in the form of type
classes, inspired by Haskell. Type classes are used in the QuickCheck
and StrongCheck libraries to support [generative testing][quickcheck], which
separates test definitions from the generation of test cases.


```purescript
import Test.QuickCheck

main = do
  quickCheck $ \xs ys ->
    isSorted $ merge (sort xs) (sort ys)
  quickCheck $ \xs ys ->
    xs `isSubarrayOf` merge xs ys
```

## Higher Order Functions

Higher-order functions allow the developer to write fluent, expressive
code. Here, higher-order functions are being used to capture some
common patterns when [working with HTML5 canvas][hof], such as saving
and restoring the context and drawing closed paths.

```purescript
import Control.Apply

import Graphics.Canvas (getCanvasElementById, getContext2D)
import Graphics.Canvas.Free

closed path = beginPath *> path <* closePath

filled shape = shape <* fill

withContext shape = save *> shape <* restore

scene :: Graphics Unit
scene = withContext do
  setFillStyle "#FF0000"

  filled $ closed do
    moveTo 0 0
    lineTo 50 0
    lineTo 25 50

main = do
  canvas <- getCanvasElementById "canvas"
  context <- getContext2D canvas

  runGraphics context scene
```
